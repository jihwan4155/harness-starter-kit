[Adoption prompt](docs/prompts/apply-to-target-repo.md)

`harness-starter-kit` is a prompt-first starter kit for applying harness
engineering to any software project. It is meant to be given to an agent as a
Git URL, cloned by that agent into the target repository, read, and adapted to
the target repository's actual tools and constraints.

The intended workflow is simple: open the target repository with your coding
agent, give it the kit URL and prompt, and let the agent clone, read, and adapt
the kit.

```text
Use this kit to apply harness engineering to this repository:

https://github.com/baskduf/harness-starter-kit

Clone the kit into ./harness-starter-kit, read it, then apply its prompt-first
harness engineering workflow to the current project.

Rules:
- Treat the current working directory as the target repository.
- Treat ./harness-starter-kit as read-only reference material after cloning.
- Inspect this repository before editing.
- Preserve existing architecture, tools, package manager, commands, docs, and
  conventions.
- Do not blindly copy templates.
- Add only the minimum useful harness pieces.
- Prefer updating existing docs/configs over duplicating them.
- Do not overwrite or delete existing files without explaining why.

Expected result:
- project-specific AGENTS.md or updated existing agent instructions
- knowledge store if no equivalent exists
- lightweight drift checks based on this repo's real rules
- local verification commands using existing tools
- adoption report with files changed, checks to run, assumptions, remaining
  manual steps, and whether ./harness-starter-kit should be removed, ignored, or
  kept before commit
```

This is not primarily an automatic installer. The target project should end up
with a practical agent harness because an agent inspected the repository and
added the smallest useful set of durable artifacts:

- `AGENTS.md` for durable agent instructions
- architecture constraints through linting, type checks, import boundaries, or
  project-specific rules
- feedback loops through tests, CI, pre-commit hooks, and clear failure messages
- a knowledge store under `docs/` for decisions, failures, conventions, and
  domain context
- garbage-collection checks that detect code, document, and structure drift

## Why This Exists

Prompting is temporary. Context is session-scoped. A harness is project-scoped.

Good harness engineering moves repeated instructions out of chat and into the
repository so agents can work inside stable rules. When an agent makes a
mistake, the long-term fix is not only to correct that output. The better fix is
to add a rule, test, document, or automated check that makes the same mistake
less likely next time.

## Quick Start

Open the target repository with your coding agent. Give the agent the Git URL
and ask it to clone the kit into `./harness-starter-kit`, read it, and apply the
workflow:

```text
Use this kit to apply harness engineering to this repository:

https://github.com/baskduf/harness-starter-kit

Clone the kit into ./harness-starter-kit, read it, then apply its prompt-first
harness engineering workflow to the current project.
```

The prompt-first workflow is the main way to use this kit because the agent can
inspect the target repository and adapt to its existing tools. During adoption,
the agent should inspect the stack, package manager, test and lint commands,
existing docs, agent instruction files, CI, and repository layout before
editing.

Before committing the target repository, decide what to do with the local
`harness-starter-kit/` clone: remove it, add it to the target `.gitignore`, or
keep it intentionally as a submodule/reference. Do not accidentally commit the
nested clone as ordinary project content.

If your agent cannot access GitHub, clone the kit yourself inside the target
repository, then ask the agent to read `./harness-starter-kit` and apply the
same workflow.

### Optional Skeleton Bootstrap

`apply_harness.py` is a skeleton bootstrapper, not a full harness adoption
engine. It creates generic starter files and profile reference snippets. It does
not inspect, merge, or validate the target repository's architecture.

Use it only when you want a quick initial file structure before agent-driven
adaptation. Preview the generated files first:

```powershell
python harness-starter-kit/scripts/apply_harness.py --target . --profile generic --dry-run
```

The script never overwrites existing files unless `--force` is provided. By
default it installs local harness skeleton files only; add `--with-ci` only when
the target repository should also receive the optional GitHub Actions harness
workflow.

```powershell
python harness-starter-kit/scripts/apply_harness.py --target . --profile generic --with-ci
```

## Harness Doctor

Run Harness Doctor to evaluate how ready a repository is for AI coding agent
collaboration.

```text
/harness doctor
```

Harness Doctor scores the repository across five areas:

- Agent Instructions
- Feedback Loops
- Durable Memory
- Structural Safety
- Adoption Clarity

The goal is not to gamify documentation. The goal is to find weak points where
coding agents are likely to repeat mistakes.

In one sentence: `harness-starter-kit` helps you diagnose and improve how ready
your repository is for AI coding agents.

The agent command lives in
[`commands/harness-doctor.md`](commands/harness-doctor.md). The scoring rubric
lives in
[`docs/scoring/harness-score-rubric.md`](docs/scoring/harness-score-rubric.md),
with example reports in
[`docs/examples/harness-doctor-report.md`](docs/examples/harness-doctor-report.md).

For an objective baseline scan, run:

```powershell
python scripts/harness_doctor.py --target .
```

Sample output:

```text
Harness Doctor Report

Score: 72/100
Grade: B

Verdict:
Useful but incomplete. This repository has durable agent instructions and some
validation loops, but it still lacks durable failure memory and CI-level
structural enforcement.

Breakdown:
- Agent Instructions: 18/20
- Feedback Loops: 14/20
- Durable Memory: 10/20
- Structural Safety: 16/20
- Adoption Clarity: 14/20
```

## Agent-Driven Adoption

In a new or existing project, the agent-driven path is the real adoption path.
The agent should inspect first, adapt second, and report the result. Give your
coding agent this prompt:

```text
Use this kit to apply harness engineering to this repository:

https://github.com/baskduf/harness-starter-kit

Clone the kit into ./harness-starter-kit if it is not already present, read it,
then apply its prompt-first harness engineering workflow to this repository.

Requirements:
- Inspect the target repository before editing.
- Identify the language, framework, package manager, test command, lint command,
  build command, CI provider, docs structure, and monorepo layout if present.
- Read existing AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README, CONTRIBUTING, and CI configs if
  they exist.
- Preserve existing architecture, tools, and conventions.
- Add or update AGENTS.md with project-specific rules.
- Add docs/decisions, docs/failures, docs/conventions, and docs/domain if they
  are missing and no equivalent knowledge store exists.
- Add lightweight drift checks under scripts/ only when they reflect real target
  repo rules, then wire stable checks into the closest existing verification
  path.
- Prefer existing linters, tests, CI, and package managers over introducing new
  ones.
- Do not overwrite existing files without explaining why.
- Finish with a short report listing files changed, checks added, assumptions,
  remaining manual integration steps, and what to do with ./harness-starter-kit
  before committing.
```

The longer version lives in
[`docs/prompts/apply-to-target-repo.md`](docs/prompts/apply-to-target-repo.md).

## Adoption Modes

Use `generic` for any project. It provides the durable harness skeleton without
assuming a language or framework.

Use `python` when the target project uses Python. It adds Python-focused
reference snippets for Ruff, mypy, vulture, and pre-commit.

Use `typescript` when the target project uses JavaScript or TypeScript. It adds
reference snippets for ESLint, dependency boundaries, unused export checks, and
package scripts.

Use `nextjs` when the target project is a Next.js app. It adds reference
snippets for `next build`, non-emitting TypeScript checks, generated-file
ignores, and current Next.js lint caveats.

Use `django` when the target project is a Django app. It adds reference
snippets for `manage.py check`, `manage.py test`, virtual environment ignores,
SQLite development database ignores, and a Python `check_harness.py` entrypoint.

Use `flask` when the target project is a Flask app. It adds reference snippets
for `unittest` discovery, Flask route checks, instance-data ignores, and a
Python `check_harness.py` entrypoint.

Use `spring` when the target project is a Spring Boot app. It adds reference
snippets for Maven or Gradle wrapper checks, Spring test commands, generated
build output ignores, local config ignores, and a Python `check_harness.py`
entrypoint.

Profiles are intentionally conservative reference material for the agent. They
are not automatic project transformations. The installer copies profile files
under `docs/harness/profiles/<profile>/` so an agent or maintainer can merge,
adapt, or ignore the relevant snippets while preserving the target project's
existing build system.

The generic drift checks are baseline hygiene checks:

- `scripts/check_docs_drift.py` catches broken local Markdown links and stale
  file references in docs.
- `scripts/check_structure.py` catches temporary and drift-prone filenames.
- `scripts/check_effectiveness_plan.py` catches missing or placeholder
  effectiveness measurement fields in adoption and effectiveness reports.

Useful architecture drift checks must come from the target repository's actual
rules. For example, if `AGENTS.md` says routes must not access the database
directly, add a check for forbidden database imports in route files. If an ADR
chooses Zustand instead of Redux, add a check that fails when Redux dependencies
appear. If generated files must live under one directory, add a structure rule
that rejects generated files elsewhere.

If a repository starts with the generic harness and later introduces a concrete
stack, run the
[`profile-absorption` checklist](docs/checklists/profile-absorption.md). It
helps decide which profile snippets should become real project scripts,
configuration, ignores, documentation, or checks.

## Installation And Drift Check Coverage

Automated fixture smoke tests cover harness installation for:

- Node.js / TypeScript
- Next.js
- Django
- FastAPI
- Flask
- React
- Spring Boot
- Vue

These fixture tests verify that the installer preserves existing files, writes
the expected profile snippets, and produces runnable generic drift checks.

Additional end-to-end adoption checks have been run manually against:

- a Node.js ES module project using `node --test`, repeated installer runs,
  the TypeScript profile `check_harness.py`, and intentional drift failures
- a FastAPI project using pytest, mypy, generated drift checks, and the FastAPI
  profile `check_harness.py`

FastAPI E2E coverage is also available as an opt-in automated test because it
creates a virtual environment and installs dependencies:

```powershell
$env:RUN_FASTAPI_E2E = "1"
python -m unittest tests.test_fastapi_profile_e2e
```

In GitHub Actions, run the `Harness Check` workflow manually and enable
`run_fastapi_e2e` to execute the same dependency-installing test.

See `examples/node-adoption-report.md` and
`examples/nextjs-adoption-report.md`, `examples/django-adoption-report.md`, or
`examples/flask-adoption-report.md` for example adoption reports. See
`examples/spring-adoption-report.md` for a Spring example.

## Effectiveness Measurement

The automated tests above verify installation behavior and runnable drift
checks. They do not prove that harness adoption reduces repeated agent mistakes.
Measure that separately with the protocol in
[`docs/evaluation.md`](docs/evaluation.md).

At adoption time, fill the Effectiveness Measurement Plan in
[`docs/templates/adoption-report.md`](docs/templates/adoption-report.md). If no
baseline exists, record harnessed-only tracking and define the next comparable
tasks, primary metric, review window, and results location. Record actual
before/after or follow-up observations with
[`docs/templates/effectiveness-report.md`](docs/templates/effectiveness-report.md).

## Local Checks

Run these checks before changing the starter kit templates or installer:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python -m py_compile scripts/apply_harness.py scripts/check_docs_drift.py scripts/check_structure.py scripts/check_effectiveness_plan.py scripts/harness_doctor.py
python scripts/check_docs_drift.py
python scripts/check_structure.py
python scripts/check_effectiveness_plan.py
python scripts/harness_doctor.py --target .
```

## Core Principle

Every recurring agent failure should be converted into at least one durable
artifact:

- a clearer instruction in `AGENTS.md`
- an automated constraint
- a test or CI check
- a decision or failure record
- a drift check

That is the heart of harness engineering.
