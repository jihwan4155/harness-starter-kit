# harness-starter-kit

**English** | [한국어](README.ko.md) | [日本語](README.ja.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

`harness-starter-kit` is a starter kit for applying harness engineering to any
software project.

The intended workflow is simple:

```text
Clone harness-starter-kit into a target project.
Ask an agent: "Read ./harness-starter-kit and apply its harness engineering guidelines
to this repo. Preserve the existing architecture and add only the minimum
missing harness files."
```

The target project should end up with a practical agent harness:

- `AGENTS.md` for durable agent instructions
- architecture constraints through linting, type checks, import boundaries, or
  project-specific rules
- feedback loops through tests, CI, pre-commit hooks, and clear failure messages
- a knowledge store under `docs/` for decisions, failures, conventions, and
  domain context
- garbage-collection checks that detect code, document, and structure drift

## Why This Exists

Prompting is temporary. Context is session-scoped. A harness is project-scoped.

Good harness engineering moves repeated instructions out of chat and into the
repository so agents can work inside stable rules. When an agent makes a
mistake, the long-term fix is not only to correct that output. The better fix is
to add a rule, test, document, or automated check that makes the same mistake
less likely next time.

## Quick Start

Clone or download this repository inside the target project:

```text
workspace/
`-- target-repo/
    |-- harness-starter-kit/
    `-- existing-project-files
```

Then open the target repository with your coding agent and give it this prompt:

```text
Read ./harness-starter-kit first. Apply the harness engineering starter kit to this
repository.

Preserve existing architecture, tools, and conventions. Add only the minimum
missing harness files. Finish with a short adoption report.
```

If you want to run the installer manually instead, preview the generated files
first:

```powershell
python harness-starter-kit/scripts/apply_harness.py --target . --profile generic --dry-run
```

The script never overwrites existing files unless `--force` is provided.

## Agent-Driven Adoption

In a new or existing project, give your coding agent this prompt:

```text
Read ./harness-starter-kit first. Apply the harness engineering starter kit to this
repository.

Requirements:
- Preserve existing architecture, tools, and conventions.
- Add or update AGENTS.md with project-specific rules.
- Add docs/decisions, docs/failures, docs/conventions, and docs/domain if they
  are missing.
- Add drift checks under scripts/ and wire them into the closest existing
  verification path.
- Prefer existing linters, tests, CI, and package managers over introducing new
  ones.
- Do not overwrite existing files without explaining why.
- Finish with a short report listing files changed, checks added, and remaining
  manual integration steps.
```

The longer version lives in
[`docs/prompts/apply-to-target-repo.md`](docs/prompts/apply-to-target-repo.md).

## Repository Layout

```text
harness-starter-kit/
|-- AGENTS.md
|-- docs/
|   |-- adoption-workflow.md
|   |-- component-map.md
|   |-- overview.md
|   |-- checklists/
|   `-- prompts/
|-- scripts/
|   `-- apply_harness.py
`-- templates/
    |-- generic/
    `-- profiles/
```

## Adoption Modes

Use `generic` for any project. It installs the durable harness skeleton without
assuming a language or framework.

Use `python` when the target project uses Python. It adds Python-focused
reference snippets for Ruff, mypy, vulture, and pre-commit.

Use `typescript` when the target project uses JavaScript or TypeScript. It adds
reference snippets for ESLint, dependency boundaries, unused export checks, and
package scripts.

Profiles are intentionally conservative. They provide snippets and guidance
instead of rewriting existing build systems.

## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Core Principle

Every recurring agent failure should be converted into at least one durable
artifact:

- a clearer instruction in `AGENTS.md`
- an automated constraint
- a test or CI check
- a decision or failure record
- a drift check

That is the heart of harness engineering.
