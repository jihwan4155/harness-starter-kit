## Verification Gate Placement

- Normal completion gate: `npm run check:harness`.
- Deterministic behavior checks included in the normal gate: `npm test`.
- Focused or manual checks outside the normal gate: live API smoke check.
- Reasons for focused/manual placement: live API smoke requires credentials and
  provider uptime.

## Failure Memory

- Recorded: none; no recurring failure was fixed.
- Detection or prevention check: not applicable because no failure record was
  added.
- Skipped: no user-visible runtime failure, high-risk bug path, failed check,
  CI failure, repeated agent mistake, or cross-environment mismatch was fixed.

## Effectiveness Measurement Plan

- Baseline available: No historical agent PR data available.
- Comparable tasks to repeat or track: next 5 route, docs, and test changes.
- Primary metric: wrong-file edits and first-pass verification success.
- Review window: next 5 comparable agent changes.
- Results location: `docs/effectiveness/harness.md`.
- Task outcome records location: `docs/effectiveness/task-outcomes/`.
