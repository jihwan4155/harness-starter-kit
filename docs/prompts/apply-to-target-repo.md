# Prompt: Apply harness-starter-kit To A Target Repository

Use this prompt from the target repository root. The agent should clone
`harness-starter-kit` into `./harness-starter-kit`, read it, and then adapt the
workflow to the target repository.

```text
Use this kit to apply harness engineering to this repository:

https://github.com/baskduf/harness-starter-kit

Clone the kit into ./harness-starter-kit, read it, then apply its prompt-first
harness engineering workflow to the current project.

Goal:
Make this repository easier and safer for coding agents to work in by adding
durable instructions, architecture constraints, feedback loops, knowledge
storage, and drift checks.

Adoption model:
This is prompt-first adoption. Do not treat the kit as an installer that knows
this repository. Clone it, read it as reference material, inspect the target
repository, and adapt the harness pattern to the target's existing architecture
and tools.

Rules:
- Treat the current working directory as the target repository.
- Treat ./harness-starter-kit as read-only reference material after cloning.
- Inspect this repository before editing.
- Identify the language, framework, package manager, test command, lint command,
  build command, CI provider, docs structure, and monorepo layout if present.
- Read existing AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README, CONTRIBUTING, and CI configs if
  they exist.
- Preserve existing architecture, tools, naming, package managers, and test
  commands.
- Add the smallest useful harness rather than a large generic framework.
- Prefer updating existing docs/configs over duplicating them.
- Do not overwrite existing files without explaining why.
- Do not delete existing files unless I explicitly ask.
- Do not edit files under ./harness-starter-kit during adoption unless I
  explicitly ask.
- Treat any stack profile files as reference snippets for you to adapt, not as
  automatic changes that must be copied into the project.
- Before finishing, tell me whether ./harness-starter-kit should be removed,
  ignored, or kept intentionally as a submodule/reference before I commit.

Expected work:
- Add or update AGENTS.md with project-specific agent instructions.
- Add docs/decisions, docs/failures, docs/conventions, and docs/domain if no
  equivalent structure exists.
- Add lightweight drift checks under scripts/ when they reflect actual target
  repo rules. Generic doc-link and temporary-file checks are baseline hygiene;
  target-specific checks should enforce real project constraints.
- Add CI or pre-commit integration only when it fits the existing project and
  explain the tradeoff first.
- Add stack-specific lint/type/test recommendations based on the detected
  language.

Drift check examples:
- If AGENTS.md says routes must not access the database directly, add a check
  that fails on forbidden database imports in route files.
- If a decision record says Zustand is the chosen state library, add a check
  that fails when Redux dependencies are added.
- If generated files must live under one directory, add a structure check that
  rejects generated files elsewhere.

Finish by reporting:
- files added or changed
- checks I can run locally
- assumptions you made
- remaining manual steps
- what to do with ./harness-starter-kit before committing

Use ./harness-starter-kit/docs/templates/adoption-report.md as the report shape
if present.
