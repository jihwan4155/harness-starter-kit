## Minimum Useful Adoption

For a very small project, the agent should add or adapt only:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/decisions/000-template.md`
- `docs/failures/000-template.md`
- `scripts/check_docs_drift.py`
- `scripts/check_structure.py`
- `scripts/check_encoding_hygiene.py`
- `scripts/check_effectiveness_plan.py`

Then grow the harness as the project and agent usage mature.
Use the optional GitHub Actions workflow skeleton with `--with-ci` only after
confirming the target repository uses GitHub Actions.

Use `/harness doctor` when the maintainer wants a diagnostic score before or
after adoption. The command reports readiness; it does not install harness
files.

Use `/harness update` after adoption when the maintainer wants to refresh the
local kit reference and selectively apply new harness guidance. The command
records the current kit source in `.harness/source.json` and reports applied,
skipped, and manual-review items.

Use `/harness refresh` after adoption when the maintainer wants to clean up the
target harness itself. The command reviews stale docs, duplicated guidance,
obsolete records, and unused checks, then reports keep, update, merge,
archive/delete candidate, and manual-review items without deleting files unless
the user explicitly approves the specific files.

Use `/harness review` before finishing a change when the maintainer wants an
opposing harness-engineering review of the current diff. The command reports
source-of-truth risks, unnecessary automation, missing checks, durable memory
gaps, overreach, and follow-up recommendations without modifying files unless
the user explicitly asks to apply fixes afterward.

Use `/harness review sub-agent` when the maintainer explicitly wants the
read-only reviewer subagent path. It uses the same report, still modifies no
files, and records a fallback reason if the active runtime cannot call a
subagent.
